Cowbird is a scannerless LALR parser generator for JavaScript.  It enable developers to create parsers for a defined grammar.  This can be used to make integrated development environments, domain specific languages, or entirely now programming languages all of which compile to Javascript.  In its current form Cowbird works as a virtual machine which can compile a grammar then parse anything written in that grammar.

Cowbird can operate as either a language recoginizer or as full-blown parser depending on how a grammar is defined.
