Cowbird is a scannerless LALR parser generator for JavaScript.  It enable developers to create parsers for a defined grammar.  This can be used to make integrated development environments, domain specific languages, or entirely new programming languages executed as Javascript.  Cowbird works as a virtual machine which can compile a grammar then parse anything written in that grammar.

Cowbird can operate as either a language recoginizer or as full-blown parser depending on how a grammar is defined.
