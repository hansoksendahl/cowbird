> The cowbird has a symbiotic relationship with venerable the Bison.

Cowbird is a scannerless LALR parser generator for JavaScript.  Cowbird enables developers to create parsers for a defined grammar.  It can be used to make integrated development environments, domain specific languages, or entirely new programming languages executed as Javascript.  Cowbird works as a virtual machine which can compile a grammar then parse anything written in that grammar.

Cowbird can operate as either a language recoginizer or as full-blown parser depending on how a grammar is defined.

## Dissecting Cowbird

Let's see what Cowbird is doing behind the scenes.

Cowbird grammar definitions take the following form.

```javascript
var parser = new Grammar(grammar, startToken);
```

Where `grammar` is an object and `startToken` is a string.

Each production in the grammar object is an array of regular expressions indexed by a non-terminal symbol.

```javascript
var parser = new Grammar({
  "Message": [
    /Cowbird is <Adjective>!/
  ],
  "Adjective": [
    /awesome/,
    /rad/,
    /the bees knees/
  ]
}, "Message");
```

Non-terminal symbols can be referenced inside a production's alternate regular expressions by surrounding the non-terminal symbol name with brackets.

Here is the grammar for the demo application.

```javascript
var parser = new Grammar({
  "Substance": [
    /<Elements>/,
    /<Multiplier> <Elements>/
  ],
  "Polymer": [
    /\( <Elements> \)/,
    /<this> <Multiplier>/,
  ],
  "Elements": [
    /<Element>/,
    /<Polymer>/,
    /<this> <Element>/,
    /<this> <Polymer>/,
  ],
  "Element": [
    /<Atom>/,
    /<this> <Multiplier>/,
  ],
  "Atom": [
    /[A-Z][a-z]*/,
  ],
  "Multiplier": [
    /[0-9]+/,
  ]
}, "Substance");
```
To parse our grammar we need only make a call to Cowbird's `parse` function.

```javascript
parser.parse("...");
```

This will run our input through Cowbird's virtual machine using the defined grammar.
